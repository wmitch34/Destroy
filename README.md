# Destroy
CSII Disojoint set project. Input file is a networ of unioned computers followed by instructions to destroy. Output is "connectivity" value after destructions:

This is a command line java application created (as a CSII assignment) in order to practice working with the disjoint set data structure. For line one, the first integer value
"n" represents the number of computers in an enemy network. The next integer "m" represents the number of connections between those computers. The third integer represents the number
if connections that we will destroy. The following m lines will contain values represeinting comuters that are connected. The next d lines will contain an integer representing which
of the m connections will be destroyed. The test input folder contains text files to be piped into the Java program. It is recommended that you pipe the program's output to
some local text file in the same directory. The correct output file contains the corresponding desired outputs for the given  inputs. To check the accuracy of the program,
file compare your piped output and the desired output. This java program should be able to handle a network of 100k computers.
